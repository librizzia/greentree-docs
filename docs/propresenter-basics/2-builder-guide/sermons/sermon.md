## Written Guide

### Intro

Let's go through the basics of making a sermon.

This will be the most basic version of a sermon, where only scripture is needed.

:::tip Links
This guide is for a minimal version of a sermon.

To see a full guide on sections like adding main points, bullet points, or sermon picture, navigate to [the Sermon Guide.](../../../category/sermons)
:::

### Planning Center

First, we'll check into Planning Center to see what scripture is needed.

![Overview](./img/minimal-sermon/0_planning_center_overview.webp)

We can click on the sermon to get an overview of what's needed.

![Overview](./img/minimal-sermon/0_planning_center_detail.webp)

In this case, it's just scripture. We'll copy the scripture as needed from here.

### ProPresenter

In ProPresenter, we'll navigate into the **Sermons** Library

![Sermon Library](../sermons/img/common/sermon_library_labeled.webp)

In the bottom left search field, we'll look for **Template**

![Playlist Highlighted](../sermons/img/common/search_for_template_labeled.webp)

![Search for Template](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/2_search_template_results.webp)

We'll right click the **Sermon - TEMPLATE** and select **Duplicate**

![Duplicate Sermon](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/3_duplicate_sermon.webp)

Right Click the duplicated sermon, and select **Rename**

![Rename Template](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/4_rename_template.webp)

We'll rename it to the date of the sermon or event, typically in **Month Day, Year** Format

![Renamed Sermon](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/5_renamed_sermon.webp)

With the sermon selected, click the **Bible** at the top toolbar to get into the **Bible Page**

![Bible Button](../sermons/img/common/bible_labeled.webp)

![Bible Page](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/6_bible_page.webp)

In the search bar, we'll paste in whatever scripture we need

![Bible Search](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/7_scripture_search_results.webp)

If scripture looks like it's taking up too many slides, or too little, try checking or unchecking **Break On Verse** from the options

![Bible Options](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/8_bible_options.webp)

With the Sermon selected, at the bottom left, click

```
Save As -> Copy to Selected
```

![Copy To Selected](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/9_copy_to_selected.webp)

:::warning
Make sure the sermon is selected when copying in scripture. Otherwise, the scripture will be added to the wrong presentation.
:::

You can now click the **Show** button at the top toolbar to go back to the presentation, where you should see the scripture added.

![Show Button](../sermons/img/common/show_labeled.webp)
![Sermon view](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/10_sermon_view.webp)

Move the blank slide from before the scripture to the end

![Move Slide](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/11_move_blank_slide_to_end.webp)

Double check that the **M** Macro on the first slide is set to `Sermon - Scripture` by hovering over it with your mouse

![Bible Options](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/12_check_macro.webp)

We'll repeat this same process for any scripture we need to add.

### Adding Sermon to Playlist

We can navigate back to our Playlist, then click the **Search** icon in the top right

![Search Icon](../sermons/img/common/search_button_labeled.webp)

We'll search for the sermon by the date or event name

![Search Result](../sermons/img/minimal-sermon/13_sermon_search_results.webp)

We can now add the sermon into our playlist in the right spot.
