# Adding Quotes

Quotes are commonly used when quoting another pastor, a speaker, a book, or other reference.

Quotes will look like this to the congregation.

![Quote Audience](../img/quotes/final_quote_audience.webp)

And like this for the live stream.

## Written Guide

### Planning Center

First, we'll get the quote we need from Planning Center.

These are typically in the sermon notes, either as an attached file or in the description.

![Quote File](../img/quotes/0_quote_file.webp)

Copy the text of the quote.

![Copy Quote](../img/quotes/1_copy_text.webp)

### ProPresenter

To add the Quote slide, in the Presentation, from the bottom left, select

```
+ -> Message -> Quote (Larger)
```

![Add Quote Quote ](../img/quotes/2_add_quote.webp)

The quote slide is now added

![Quote Slide Added](../img/quotes/3_quote_slide_added.webp)

Right click the new slide, and select **Edit**

![Edit Slide](../img/quotes/4_edit_slide.webp)

This will bring you to the edit page of the slide.

![Edit Quote Page](../img/quotes/5_edit_quote_page.webp)

Select the text in the middle (you'll see **Quote** selected in blue on the side under **Objects**), and select **Paste and Match Style**

![Paste and Match Style Quote](../img/quotes/6_paste_and_match_style.webp)

![Quote Pasted](../img/quotes/7_quote_pasted.webp)

You can repeat this process, copying and pasting the author's name and selecting **Paste and Match Style**

![Author Pasted](../img/quotes/8_author_pasted.webp)

Go back to the **Show** view at the top

![Show Tab](../img/common/show_labeled.webp)

Right click the slide, and select

```
Add Action -> Macro -> Sermon - Quote
```

![Place Cursor](../img/quotes/13_add_macro.webp)

The quote should now be added on the screens.

You can repeat this process for any other quotes.

![alt text](../img/quotes/14_quotes_added.webp)

### Reflow Quotes

If the quote is there is too much text on screen, it can be hard for the viewer the follow along.

That's why it's necessary to separate the quote between a few slides, so more text can be on screen.

![Author Pasted](../img/quotes/8_author_pasted.webp)

In the above screenshot, while the whole quote is on the screen, it's a bit too much much. We want to keep the quote at around 5-8 lines lines.

In the example, it's at 11 lines, and looks too wordy.

Here's how to fix it

1. From the top toolbar, select **Reflow**

   ![Select Reflow](../../../img/common/pp7_reflow_labeled.webp)

2. Scroll down in the text, and click to place the cursor where you want to split the slides.

   ![Place Cursor](../img/quotes/cropped-9_place_cursor.webp)

3. At the bottom left, click **Insert Slide Break** to split the slides

You'll see the slides are now split.

![Place Cursor](../img/quotes/10_insert_slide_break.webp)

However, there is a bug in ProPresenter 7.10 that duplicates the text to the next slide, instead of just splitting it

#### Solution

Select the duplicated text, and delete it

![Place Cursor](../img/quotes/12_slides_seperated.webp)
