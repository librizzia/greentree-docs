# Scripture Reading

## Written Guide

### Planning Center

In Planning Center, scripture reading is typically done by a speaker from the audience, or it's something put in by a worship leader.

In this case, it's added between a few songs, and was labeled "Responsive Reading"

Click on the item to get more detail if needed.

All we really need is the scripture they're referencing, which can be in the title AND the description.

OR the info may only be in the title.

Either way, copy the scripture as needed.
