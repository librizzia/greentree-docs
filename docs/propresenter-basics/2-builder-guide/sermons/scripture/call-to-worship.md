# Call to Worship

## Written Guide

The call to worship is typically done right at the beginning of service, as the first pastor comes to the podium.

Scripture will look like this for the congregation

And like this for the live stream

Here's how to add it.

### Planning Center

In Planning Center, scripture reading is typically done by a speaker from the audience, or it's something put in by a worship leader.

In this case, it's added between a few songs, and was labeled "Responsive Reading"

Click on the item to get more detail if needed.

All we really need is the scripture they're referencing, which can be in the title AND the description.

![Planning Center Scripture Both](../img/common/planning_center_more_info.webp)

OR the info may only be in the title.

Either way, copy the scripture as needed.
