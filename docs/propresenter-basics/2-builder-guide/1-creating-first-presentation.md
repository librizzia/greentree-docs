# Creating First Presentation

The start building our slides in ProPresenter 7, we'll first need to create our presentation.

Navigate to the **Library View**, and find the correct Year and Month under **Playlist**

![ProPresenter Overview](../img/1/pp7.webp)

1. Click on the current month to select it. Then, in the top right corner of the Library View. Click the **+** icon to show options for creating a presentation.

From the Dropdown, select **New Playlist From Template** -> **SUNDAY TEMPLATE - BLANK**

![Library Selection](../img/1/create-from-playlist.webp)

This will add a new, empty presentation into the folder we had selected.

2. Right Click the empty presentation (it should be called 'SUNDAY TEMPLATE - Blank') and rename it to the date of the service (ie March 24, 2024)

You'll now have an empty presentation, ready to be built up into the Sunday Service
