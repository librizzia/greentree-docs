# Special Services

## Written Guide

For services that we don't run every week, like our normal Sunday Morning Gathering, these will go under **Special Services**.

There can be things like a holiday, such as Christmas or Good Friday, a memorial service, or an event, like a summer camp or media arts camp.

Below are either links to the relevant pages, or a short excerpt on running the required service.
