# Service Graphic

## Intro

Some services will have a one time graphic needed. It's a very similar process to [adding announcements.](../announcements/announcement-loops)

With a Special Service Graphics, it's typically only needed for one night or for the special event.

This is the special graphic we'll be adding.

Here's how to add it.

## Written Guide

### Planning Center

In Planning Center, we'll find the service graphic attached at the **Greeting / Inro**

7. Change **Pre Service 2 Timer** to be at the start of the service

   ![Change Timer](../special-services/img/service-graphic/7_countdown_time-changed.webp)

8. With our slide now properly added, let's move it where it needs to be. In this case, at the greeting / before service.

   ![Change Timer](../special-services/img/service-graphic/8_move_graphic_to_top.webp)

The one time service graphic is now added to the playlist properly.
