# Announcement Slides

## Written Guide

Announcements happen right before the sermon, and after prayer.

They'll look like this to the audience.

And like this for the live stream.

### Planning Center

Similarly to the announcements, first, we need to download the slides from Planning Center.

These can be found by clicking on the **Announcements** under Church Life to bring up the detail view.

![Planning Center](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/0_planning_center_announcements.webp)

Then, download **Announcement Slides - DATE** from the Files Tab

### Import Slides

First, let's import the slides into ProPresenter.

1. In ProPresenter, select

```
File -> Import -> PowerPoint
```

![Import PowerPoint](../announcements/img/announcements/0_import_powerpoint.webp)

Select the **Announcement Slides - Current Date** from **Downloads**, and click Import

![Import Slides](../announcements/img/announcements/1_import_announcements.webp)

From the Library Selection drop down, select the **Announcements** Library

![Library Selection](../announcements/img/announcements/2_import_into_announcements_library.webp)

The Announcement Slides will now be imported at the bottom of the playlist

![Announcements Imported](../announcements/img/announcements/3_imported_at_bottom.webp)

You can move the announcement slides into the right place, after the name slide under the **Announcements** header

### Add Macro

Right click the first slide of the announcements, and select

```
Add Action -> Macro -> POST-SERVICE
```

![Library Selection](../announcements/img/announcements/4_add_announcements_macro.webp)

You can also add the macro by clicking and dragging the yellow **POST-SERVICE** macro from the Macro page, and letting go over the first slide.
