# Pre and Post Slides

Every service, we have slides that runs during the pre-service, before the service starts and post service, after the service ends.

We call these **Pre Slides** and **Post Slides**, so let's learn how to build them out.

## Written Guide

### First Steps

Similarly to the announcements, first, we need to download the slides from Planning Center.

These can be found by clicking on the **Announcements** under Church Life to bring up the detail view.

![Planning Center](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/0_planning_center_announcements.webp)

Then, download **Pre Post Slides - DATE** from the Files Tab

![Planning Center](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/0_planning_center_announcements_files.png)

### Import Slides

First, let's import the slides into ProPresenter.

1. In ProPresenter, select

```
File -> Import -> PowerPoint
```

![Import PowerPoint](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/1_import_powerpoint.webp)

2. Select _Pre Post Slides - Current Date_ from the files list in Downloads

   ![Select Pre Post](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/2_import_pre_post_slides.webp)

   Make sure it's being imported into the **Announcement Loops** Library

   ![Import into Announcements Library](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/2_import_into_announcement_loops_library.webp)

   The annoucements should now be imported, and at the bottom of the Playlist

![Import into Announcements Library](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/3_pre_post_imported_at_bottom.webp)

3. Right Click the Announcements Loop, select **Show in Library**

   ![Show in Library](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/4_show_in_library.webp)

   You'll now be in the **Announcement Loops** library with the announcement slides selected

   ![In Library](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/5_pre_post_in_library.webp)

4. Rename Pre Post Slides

   Right click the Pre Post Slides, select Rename, and rename to "Pre and Post Slides - Month Day, Year"

   ![Rename Slides](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/6_rename_pre_post.webp)

   ![Renamed Slides](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/7_pre_post_renamed.webp)

5. Set Advance Timer

From the presentation toolbar, select the timer, and set it to **10 seconds**

![Advance Timer](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/8_set_10_timer_closeup.webp)

The toolbar should now read 10.0, meaning it'll advance to the next slides after 10 seconds and loop around.

### Pre Slides

1. Duplicate the Pre Post Announcement Loop slides

![Test](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/9_duplicate_pre_post.webp)

2. Rename them to **Pre Slides - Month Day, Year**

![Test](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/10_rename_to_pre.webp)

![Test](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/11_renamed_to_pre.webp)

3. With the **Pre Slides** selected, add the **PRE-SERVICE MACRO** to the first slide

You can do this by right clicking the first slide and selecting

```
Add Action -> Macro -> PRE-SERVICE
```

![Test](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/12_add_pre_macro.webp)

This can also be done by navigating to the Macro page and clicking and dragging the yellow **PRE-SERVICE** macro to the first slide before letting go to place it there.

### Post Slides

1. Duplicate the Pre Post Announcement Loop slides

![Test](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/9_duplicate_pre_post.webp)

2. Rename them to **Post Slides - Month Day, Year**

![Test](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/10_rename_to_pre.webp)

![Test](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/13_renamed_to_post.webp)

3. Remove unneeded slides

Remove slides that aren't relevant for after service

Typically, these are slides like the **Welcome Slides** and **Child Care Dropoff**

Right click the irrelevant slide and select **Delete**

![Remove irrelevant slides](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/nonrelevant_slides.webp)

After removing irrelevant slides, it should look like this.

![test](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/14_removed_slides.webp)

4. Add Post Service Macro

With the **Post Slides** selected, add the **POST-SERVICE MACRO** to the first slide

You can do this by right clicking the first slide, and selecting

```
Add Action -> Macro -> POST-SERVICE
```

![test](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/15_post_macro.webp)

### Add Slides to Playlist

Click the Search icon in the top left

![Search](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/pp7-search-arrow.webp)

Search for "Month Day, Year"

![Search for Slides](../announcements/img/announcement_loops/16_search_results_announcements.webp)

You should see everything relevant for that service, which is why we name it that way.

Place the Pre and Post slides appropriately either at the **Pre-Service header** or **Post Service Header**
