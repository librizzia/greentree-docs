# Getting Started

Let's run through the basics of **serving in the media minitry in less than 5 minutes**.

## Intro

There are two main responsibilites, or roles in running projection - a **slide builder** and **slide operator**.

A **slide builder** builds out the slides week by week. This includes adding songs, scripture, announcements and other media.

A **slide operator** operates the presentation, including advancing slides, small modifications to the presentations, such as songs, and presenting parent codes.

Starting out, you'll only be responsible with operating the slides. Whenever you feel comfortable and ready, we'll train you in building out the slides for presentations.

## Getting Started

To get started, a team leader should train you over about a month in our onboarding process to run projection for services.

If you ever feel lost or uncertain about a process, you can always contact a member of the projection team for assitance, we're there to provide guidance and answer any questions you have.
